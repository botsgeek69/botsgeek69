## 🎯 Overview

This pseudocode system is based on the ~English revised esolang syntax, designed to create algorithms that read like natural English while maintaining proper control flow documentation through embedded flowchart notation in comments.

The system bridges the gap between human-readable documentation and executable pseudocode, making it ideal for:

- **Educational contexts** where beginners need to understand programming logic
- **Algorithm documentation** that remains readable by non-technical stakeholders  
- **System design** where complex workflows need clear documentation
- **Rapid prototyping** before implementing in production languages

## 🚀 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🗣️ **Natural Language** | Code reads like English sentences |
| 🔄 **Loose Syntax** | Flexible sentence structure with multiple keyword synonyms |
| 📊 **Embedded Flow Documentation** | Flowchart symbols embedded in comments for structure clarity |
| 🔢 **Optional Numbering** | Simple sequential numbering system for complex algorithms |

## 📝 Statement Types

### 1. Declaration
Creates new variables/objects with generic types.

```
Create a variable named username.
Make another variable called age.
Declare a new object named userProfile.
```

### 2. Display/Output
Shows numbers, strings, or data to user.

```
Display "Hello world!" and a newline.
Show "Your name is ", the username, "." and a newline.
Print the age and another newline.
```

### 3. Function Calls
Calls built-in or user-defined functions.

```
Set the value of age to call function "to number" with call another function "ask".
Vary the value of username by call the function "ask".
```

### 4. While Loops
Provides loop functionality.

```
While the age is smaller than 0 do:
    Display "Invalid age entered." and a newline.
That's all.
```

### 5. If...Else Conditionals
Conditional branching statements.

```
If the username equals "admin" then:
    Display "Welcome administrator!" and a newline.
That's all.
Else, then:
    Display "Welcome user!" and a newline.
That's all.
```

### 6. Stop
Terminates the program.

```
Stop the program.
Stop this program.
```

### 7. Comments/Notes
Documentation and flowchart notation.

```
Note: This validates user input
Note: [DECISION] Check if username exists
```

## 📚 Glossary of Elemental Units (EU) and Data Structures (DS)

The following table provides abbreviations used to denote elemental units (building blocks) and complex data structures that can be referenced within your pseudocode. These enable concise, standardized references to common computer science concepts, integrating seamlessly with the natural language flow.

| Abbreviation | Name | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| **EU-NODE** | Node | Basic building block containing data and pointers/references |
| **EU-EDGE** | Edge | Connection/link between nodes; may be directional or weighted |
| **EU-PTR** | Pointer/Reference | Memory address or reference to another component |
| **EU-KVP** | Key–Value Pair | Fundamental binding of a key to a value in maps or hash tables |
| **DS-ARR** | Array | Fixed-size or dynamic indexed collection |
| **DS-LIST** | Linked List | Linear sequence of nodes connected by pointers |
| **DS-BST** | Binary Search Tree | Ordered binary tree for efficient lookup |
| **DS-GRAPHADJ** | Adjacency List/Matrix | Graph representation using lists or matrices |
| **DS-HASHMAP** | Hash Map | Key-value store with hashing for fast access |
| **DS-STACK** | Stack | LIFO data structure |
| **DS-QUEUE** | Queue | FIFO data structure |

### Usage Conventions in Pseudocode

**Declaration:** Use the abbreviations when declaring variables or objects:
```
Create a variable named currentNode of type EU-NODE.
Declare a new DS-LIST called userList.
```

**Assignment and Function Calls:**
```
Set the value of currentNode to call function "get head" of DS-LIST userList.
```

**Embedded Documentation with Flowchart Notation:**
```
Note: [DECISION][EU-NODE] Check if current node is null
If currentNode equals null then:
    Note: [OUTPUT] Display "End of list reached."
    Display "No more nodes." and a newline.
That's all.
```

**Error Handling:**
```
Note: [ERROR][EU-KVP] Invalid key-value pair insertion
Display "Error: Invalid key." and a newline.
```

## 📊 Flowchart Notation System

### Basic Symbols
Embedded within Note statements to document control flow:

| Symbol | Meaning | Usage Example |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `[START]` | Program beginning | `Note: [START] Initialize application` |
| `[END]` | Program termination | `Note: [END] Close application` |
| `[INPUT]` | Data input operations | `Note: [INPUT] Get user credentials` |
| `[OUTPUT]` | Data output operations | `Note: [OUTPUT] Display results` |
| `[PROCESS]` | General processing | `Note: [PROCESS] Calculate total` |
| `[DECISION]` | Conditional branching | `Note: [DECISION] Valid password?` |
| `[DOCUMENT]` | Reports/printouts | `Note: [DOCUMENT] Generate user report` |
| `[MANUAL]` | Manual input prompt | `Note: [MANUAL] Wait for user confirmation` |
| `[CONNECTOR]` | On-page flow connection | `Note: [CONNECTOR] Continue main flow` |
| `[OFF-PAGE]` | Off-page connection | `Note: [OFF-PAGE] See validation module` |

### Control Statement Notation

| Symbol | Meaning | Usage Example |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `[CS-SS]` | Selection Statement | `Note: [CS-SS] If-else condition block` |
| `[CS-IS]` | Iteration Statement | `Note: [CS-IS] While/for loop structure` |
| `[CS-JS]` | Jump Statement | `Note: [CS-JS] Break, continue, or goto` |

### File System and Build Notation

| Symbol | Meaning | Usage Example |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `[FOLDER]` | Directory/folder operations | `Note: [FOLDER] Create project structure` |
| `[FILE]` | File operations | `Note: [FILE] Generate source code` |
| `[INI]` | Configuration file content | `Note: [INI] IDE project settings` |

### Optional Numbering System
For complex algorithms requiring clear execution order:

```
Note: [1-START] Begin user authentication
Note: [2-INPUT] Collect username and password
Note: [3-DECISION] Credentials valid?
Note: [3A-PROCESS] Grant access (if valid)
Note: [3B-OUTPUT] Show error message (if invalid)
Note: [4-END] Complete authentication process
```

**Numbering Guidelines:**
- Use simple sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...)
- Use letters for branches (3A, 3B, 3C...)
- Keep numbering simple to maintain readability
- Consider renumbering complexity when inserting steps

> **Note:** You may now optionally embed abbreviation tags in flowchart notes for enhanced documentation, e.g., `Note: [PROCESS][DS-BST] Insert key into search tree node`

## ⚠️ System Error Handling Protocol

🔒 All programs written in the ~English Revised Pseudocode System follow a standardized error handling protocol to ensure consistent error management and debugging across all implementations.

### Error Response Procedure

1. **🚨 On Error:** When any error condition is detected during program execution
2. **⏸️ Pause Program:** Immediately halt program execution to prevent cascading failures
3. **🔍 Self Diagnosis:** If the program has diagnostic capabilities, perform automated system checks to gather additional context about the error state
4. **👤 User Interaction:** Prompt the user for input and feedback regarding the error condition, including:
   - What operation was being performed when the error occurred
   - Any unusual circumstances or recent changes
   - User's assessment of the error severity and impact
5. **📋 Report Generation:** Create a comprehensive error report containing:
   - Complete error details and stack trace information
   - User feedback and input collected in step 4
   - Current date and timestamp
   - System environment information
   - Program state and variable values at time of error
   - Relevant configuration settings and file paths
6. **📤 Repository Logging:** Automatically commit the error report to `error_log.md` in the appropriate folder of the relevant GitHub repository for the project

### Error Report Format
Error reports should be structured as markdown entries in `error_log.md` with consistent formatting for easy analysis and tracking of recurring issues.

### Protocol Benefits
- ✅ **Consistent Error Handling:** All programs behave predictably when errors occur
- 🤝 **User Engagement:** Users become active participants in the debugging process
- 📚 **Comprehensive Documentation:** Every error is properly logged with full context
- 🔗 **Repository Integration:** Error tracking becomes part of the project's version control history
- 📈 **Continuous Improvement:** Error patterns can be analyzed over time to improve system reliability

**Example:**
```
Note: [ERROR][DS-HASHMAP] Collision handling failure during insertion
Display "Hash map insertion error." and a newline.
```

## ✨ Syntax Features

### Flexible Punctuation
Sentences can end with:
- Period (.)
- Exclamation mark (!)
- Question mark (?)

### Keyword Synonyms
Multiple ways to express the same concept, with semantic meaning based on context:

**Output Operations:**
- **Display** → Print debugging, temporary output, informal logging
- **Show** → Formal program output, user interface elements  
- **Print** → Reports, formatted output, final results

**Example Usage:**
```
Display "Debug: username is ", username, "."  // Temporary debug output
Show "Your account balance is $", balance, "." // User interface display
Print "Monthly Report - Generated ", date, "." // Formal document output
```

**Variable Operations:**
- **Create/Make/Declare** → Variable initialization
- **Set/Vary/Change** → Variable modification

### Programming Context
The natural language approach means keyword choice carries semantic meaning about the programmer's intent. Display statements naturally stand out when scanning code for debug statements to remove, while Show and Print indicate more permanent program functionality.

### Natural Language Flow
Code should read as naturally as possible:

```
Note: [START] Begin password validation
Create a variable named password.
Note: [INPUT] Get user password
Display "Enter your password: " and a newline.
Set the value of password to call function "ask".
Note: [CS-SS] Selection statement for password validation
Note: [DECISION] Check password strength
If the password length is less than 8 then:
    Note: [OUTPUT] Inform user of requirements
    Display "Password must be at least 8 characters." and a newline.
    Note: [CS-JS] Jump back to input (implied goto)
    Note: [CONNECTOR] Return to input
That's all.
Note: [END] Password validation complete
```

## 📁 File System Structure Documentation

### Folder and File Tree Notation
The system supports nested folder/file structure documentation for creating complete project hierarchies:

```
Note: [FOLDER] Project root directory structure
Create a folder named MyProject.
Note: [FOLDER] Source code directory
Inside MyProject, create a folder named src.
Note: [FILE] Main application file
Inside src, create a file named main.c.
Note: [FILE] Utility functions
Inside src, create a file named utils.c.
Note: [FOLDER] Header files directory
Inside MyProject, create a folder named include.
Note: [FILE] Function declarations
Inside include, create a file named utils.h.
Note: [FOLDER] Build output directory
Inside MyProject, create a folder named build.
Note: [FOLDER] Object files subdirectory
Inside build, create a folder named obj.
Note: [FOLDER] Executable files subdirectory
Inside build, create a folder named bin.
Note: [FOLDER] Configuration directory
Inside MyProject, create a folder named config.
Note: [INI] IDE project configuration
Inside config, create a file named project.ini.
```

💡 This notation allows programs like Manus to automatically generate complete file/folder trees in the correct order for platforms like GitHub.
